# Learning Journal - Week 4

## Learning Activities

This week in the lecture we were demonstrated the use of child themes in Wordpress. Child themes can be used to extend themes with additional styling for elements, particularly useful for modifying a theme moderately. If the edit is very small, CSS can be added to the element, and if the changes are major, a whole new theme can be created, but in the middle of the two is the perfect application of child themes.

## Resources/Links

When working on the practical I used Bitnami Wordpress for local development. This allowed to me run and develop my site offline with easy access to the file system and other useful resources.

## Estimated Hours

My practical work was part of my assignment, so I spent extra time working on it trying to polish it ready for when it needs to be submitted. I also need to create the site in a second CMS (I will probably end up using Joomla again regardless of my feeling about it) but Wordpress makes it fairly easy to make the site look and function well. I spent approximately 6 hours on the practical, since some parts were already created in previous weeks, and I hadn't created it to the complete extent that the final submission will have.

## Content Insights

The most meaningful insight from this week is realising how simple changing the theme of a Wordpress site can be. Because the builder creates components for different bits, you can create different themes and rapidly switch around - including child themes - to design it the way you like. I ended up settling for a modified twentytwentytwo, since I created a child theme to add additional styling to it.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Wordpress is very popular in the workforce, any browsing of job listings will make that clear. I used to not see the point for larger scale businesses, but implementing a contact plugin with a few clicks rather than spending an hour or so rigging one up myself made me see how it could be beneficial in certain situations.
