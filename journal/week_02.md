# Learning Journal - Week 2

## Learning Activities

In the lecture this week we learnt about the basics of how websites work, talking about static vs dynamic, conventions, front-end/back-end, and the basics of how HTTP GET works when fetching sites across the internet. We also learnt about the extent of CMS use around the world, particularly with products like WordPress, and how they can be used by both those who are and aren't tech savvy. Most of this content I already knew from working on web development in the past, but I've never worked with a CMS before so it was good to get some insights about them.

## Resources/Links

When creating my site I used [this site](https://flatuicolors.com) to select a colour scheme. I created it using Nextjs with Typescript and Sass, which made it easy to quickly whip up a simple site that fits the criteria. The image I used is a screenshot of a past project I was working on that could have used a platform like the one my site was made for. The purpose of the product was to create a simple tournament API that could let the developers only really need to deal with creating their front-end which is what the screenshot was of, representing a real situation it could be effectively used in.

## Estimated Hours

I spent roughly 2.5 hours on this week's practical. I am already fairly familiar with Nextjs, and I have already exported and uploaded sites like this in the past so getting the site online was pretty quick as well.

## Content Insights

One of the challenges I faced when trying to setup the site was that I've never wanted to post an exported site in a subdirectory of the domain (in this case /CP3402/prac_01). Because of this I had to learn how to correctly configure the export so that it would treat everything correctly, accessing files from the correct locations.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

In the past I have chosen to ignore the existence of CMS platforms, preferring the do-it-yourself approach, however seeing the usage of these services (and the demand for developers to work on them) made me realise it's far more deep than I had originally realised. I often confused CMS with website builders, and shrugged it off as something to you if you don't know how to build websites, but having realised you can still write your own code but develop it on top of a CMS I think that it will be very useful as the subject progresses to learn more about these platforms and how to work with them.
