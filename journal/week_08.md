# Learning Journal - Week 8

## Learning Activities

In this week's lecture we went into a more detailed approach to creating a custom theme for Wordpress. These themes are different to our past work since we've typically been building a child theme, but for our upcoming assignment we need to create our own from just a starter theme and not have any site-specific styling, since these are meant to work across different sites.

## Resources/Links

The prac this week was to create a simple PHP site, which didn't need any special resources or anything. I used XAMPP to run my Apache server, but aside from that there is nothing worth mentioning.

## Estimated Hours

This prac was fairly straightforward, since we only needed to fulfil a set of PHP syntax requirements. I have used PHP in the past so I vaguely remember some parts, and with other language experience it was fairly easy to get the site up and working as expected. I probably only spent an hour or so on this week's practical.

## Content Insights

It was relieving to see we will be able to be writing some of our own PHP for the upcoming parts of this subject. It is refreshing after all of the CMS GUI work and so on to be able to write some code, and feels like it can be controlled much better.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

PHP is a very commonly used language, which a huge chunk of the internet using it. Having some familiarity with PHP will be useful because we will have this understanding of the developing process with PHP. Knowing details and more intricate uses of languages is good as well of course, but it is fairly easy to learn as well.
