# Learning Journal - Week 12

## Learning Activities

In this week's lecture we learnt about good practices for our presentations. We learnt about making a goal driven presentation that fulfils the needs of the audience with confidence, and how to avoid making a boring or tedious presentation. Group work is very important, such as effective hand offs which keep the flow of the presentation, and working together as a team is essential for this sort of assessment.

## Resources/Links

Our presentation was submitted through LearnJCU, but we did not use other resources to create it. Aside from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2022-1-site-team08) itself, most of the work was done locally and through screen share.

## Estimated Hours

We originally planned to arrive at university midday and do a bit of work before recording our presentation, but unfortunately we had a lot of issues trying to update the content on our staging server. Because of this, we ended up staying at uni for around 5 hours trying to fix it, and ended up doing our actual presentation as a recording on Discord for an hour or so later that evening.

## Content Insights

Our practice presentation was far from perfect as we were running very low on time so unfortunately we didn't use everything we had learnt during the lecture. However, this knowledge will be very useful for our upcoming assessed presentation, as we can rewrite our script and better prepare for our next one.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Being able to talk in front of a team and develop creative ideas is essential for many forms of employment. This kind of experience is useful for many faucets of work, so practicing it especially with a team is valuable.
