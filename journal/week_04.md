# Learning Journal - Week 4

## Learning Activities

This week we learnt about the logistics of local development and staging releases. This involved using things like Git to handle updates on the live server, with testing and development done safely and separately to what is live. From past experience in web development, I have already been using Git for my CI/CD through Github to Azure, so I already had a fairly good understanding about the approach. However, I have never made staging and testing servers within the pipeline, and I have regretably not done any unit testing on my live services.

## Resources/Links

This week the site I created was made using [wordpress](https://wordpress.com). I had to use Google to find my way around the UI and achieve certain tasks, but nothing particularly mentionable. The design was built using one of the wordpress themes and the content of the page came from the previous practical using Joomla.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 5 hours this week on the practical tasks. The two hour blocked out for the practical on campus was spent on talking with other students in the group learning tasks, and I spent another 3 hours or so working on the rest of the week's work.

## Content Insights

I have known about staging environments in the past, but I have never thought to actually set one up to try things. I think this would be very useful in future on larger scale projects that cannot be at the risk of downtime from errors that made it through my limited testing. This comes hand-in-hand with better testing, which I have been using elsewhere but I haven't gone back and setup tests on older projects I'm updating and maintaining.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Talking with the other group members was very insightful for employability and so on. Many students asked similar questions, and one that stuck out that I wasn't prepared for was being asked where I want to be in a few years. I've known I want to get into this field for a long time now, but I've always been thinking more short-term, not considering what kind of career path I want to take after university and a few years of lower ranking work.

One question I put in my question sheet was to see what grade people were aiming to get in the class. While I was expecting mostly high grades like D and HD, some people had said they were only looking to pass, which I found surprising. Going through a university course is optional, and I would have thought they would be looking to get the most out of it, but apparently that isn't exactly the case. This also made me realise the people I originally planned to group up with may not have been the best pick, since one of them had this opinion.
