# Learning Journal - Week 6

## Learning Activities

This week's lecture heavily focused on how to effectively work with our group for our upcoming group assignment. We went over using software like Slack, Trello, Git, and so on to make working together as managable as possible. We also talked about expectations and how to be a good team member, which is to hopefully make the group task not as disorganised as they can be.

## Resources/Links

The practical this week was to create a wordpress child theme, which I did so by using my code editor (VSCode) to create the new folder and rewrite the php files so that it would show up correctly in Wordpress. I then uses sass to create the child theme, so that the sass compiler would create the browser-readable css.

## Estimated Hours

Given this practical was also used as part of the assignment, I had taken my time to make it the way I wanted. I made it so that it could create some custom elements for my specific task, as well as some modifications to the normal elements to better suit my design. Creating the theme would have taken a few hours, but I can't pinpoint an exact amount of time.

## Content Insights

I was really glad to be able to use sass with Wordpress, since I've been working with sass for a decent while now on other projects. Unfortunately it seemed to require a lot of _!important_ attributes because it didn't seem to take priority in some instances for some reason.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Being able to use css and pre-processors is very important for web development work, and it's interesting to see how it is implemented in content management systems like Wordpress. While I still prefer a normal site where you link to the css files directly, the way Wordpress does it suits the general gist of Wordpress.
