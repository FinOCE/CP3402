# Learning Journal - Week 7

## Learning Activities

In this week's lecture we learnt about PHP, as well as some very basic uses of SQL with it. I've already done the CP2404 which goes much more in depth with SQL, but this was focused on how you run the queries in your PHP code instead of the SQL itself. We learnt a lot of the syntax for the language, including some popular use cases and important aspects.

## Resources/Links

This week's practical involved the use of Trello, Slack, and Github. Most of the content from these is private so links can't be shared because they are inaccessible without the authentication.

## Estimated Hours

On this week's practical I spent ~3 hours on it. The practical was mostly about setting up the group for the upcoming assignment with the slack, trello, and github. We did this mostly in class, but at home I also added the task sheet to the git repo so that we had some content, since it was a requirement for the practical.

## Content Insights

The main insight I got from this week was the use of integrations with slack. It was very easy to setup the notifications when people commit to github or make changes to trello, which makes me undertand why slack can be very popular for businesses.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Gaining experience with a lot of these services is very useful for future employment, since they are all very commonly used outside of the university. Having some familiarity with them is very good because it can give us the edge on particularly other candidates without the same experience, since it isn't ideal to need to teach the employees how to use things when other candidates are already comfortable with them.
