# Learning Journal - Week 10

## Learning Activities

In this week's lecture we learnt about user-centred design and creating a good and clear user experience. This involed simple and goal driven design that looks good and encourages use. One of the focuses was on the use of white space, since it can be a powerful technique to show detail or meaning without crowding the frame.

## Resources/Links

Because I've already got a fair bit of experience with CSS and SASS, working with SCSS was very straightforward, so I didn't need to use external resources to build my simple site.

## Estimated Hours

I spent up to an hour working on the practical, since I already was fairly comfortable setting up and building the site. The site was created purely to demonstrate the use of the sass features, so it wouldn't be intended for an actual design, but instead fulfils the expectations of the practical.

## Content Insights

Sass and other CSS pre-processors are clearly an incredibly useful tool for developers, since they allow you to calculate and automate many things that would otherwise be very tedious for CSS. The most prominant in my opinion is the use of variables and partial files, since it allows you to compile a single file with all necessary content and easily change paramaters in a single place rather than sifting through the entire file or files.

## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

Sass is the most popular pre-processor, so naturually most jobs that involve CSS will expect it's use. It is therefore a valuable skill to have for employment and also demonstrates an understanding of working with similar developer tools, since there are similar types of things that can be used elsewhere, such as Typescript in place of Javascript.
